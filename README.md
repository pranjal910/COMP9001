#🗝️ Vault of Shadows — Text-Based Escape Adventure
Vault of Shadows is a terminal-based puzzle adventure game where players must escape a dark, mysterious dungeon by solving thematic challenges. The player begins with 3 lives and must choose 3 out of 5 unique rooms to explore. Each room presents a different logic-based riddle, cipher, or pattern recognition task—such as deciphering mirrored numbers, musical note sequences, or encoded messages.

Correct answers earn a digit; incorrect answers cost a life. After completing the rooms, the player must use the discovered digits to unlock a final vault. The game incorporates randomness to ensure replayability, including randomly assigned room digits. It features colored terminal output, atmospheric slow-typed text, and modular code structure using Python classes.

Lose all lives and the shadows consume you. Solve it all, and escape to glory.
